# Fixture-Generator

In ABC premier league, there are 10 teams. You have been hired to build a program that will generate fixtures for these teams based on the following given rules.

A team must play every other team twice, i.e. in their home stadium and away stadium. At some point, teams from the same local town will have to play each other, these teams should only meet after they have played teams from other local towns.
Only 4 teams can play in a given weekend, for example CKlein Stars vs Dolpins FC and Wolves FC vs SeaHorses FC.
While developing the fixtures, indicate the local town, stadium, leg (i.e. 1 or 2) and the weekend (indicate as weekend #1, weekend #2 etc.) the teams are meant to meet.
Display the final table in a CSV file (and on screen) to show the generated fixtures:
